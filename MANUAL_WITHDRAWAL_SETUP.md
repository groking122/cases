# 💸 Manual Withdrawal System Setup

This system replaces complex blockchain minting with a simple manual withdrawal process. Much better approach!

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User wins item** → Can sell for credits (instant) OR request cash withdrawal
2. **Cash withdrawal request** → Sends you email notification with payment details  
3. **You process manually** → Send money via PayPal, bank transfer, etc.
4. **Mark as completed** → User gets confirmation email

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run the SQL script in your Supabase database
psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-db -f sql-scripts/manual-withdrawal-system.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables (Optional Email)
Add to your `.env.local`:
```env
# Optional: Email notifications
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
ADMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Admin Dashboard
- Visit `/admin/withdrawals` to manage requests
- View pending withdrawals
- Mark as processing → completed
- Add payment confirmation notes
