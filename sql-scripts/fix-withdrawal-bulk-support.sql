-- ðŸ”§ Fix Withdrawal System for Bulk Credit Withdrawals
-- This script removes the NOT NULL constraint on case_opening_id to support bulk withdrawals

-- Step 1: Remove the foreign key constraint temporarily
ALTER TABLE withdrawal_requests 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS fk_withdrawal_case_opening;

-- Step 2: Make case_opening_id nullable
ALTER TABLE withdrawal_requests 
ALTER COLUMN case_opening_id DROP NOT NULL;

-- Step 3: Re-add the foreign key constraint but allow NULL values
ALTER TABLE withdrawal_requests 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_withdrawal_case_opening 
FOREIGN KEY (case_opening_id) REFERENCES case_openings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Step 3.5: Update withdrawal_type constraint to include 'ada' if needed
-- First, try to drop any existing withdrawal_type check constraints
